Every day behind the scenes, our AI retrains itself and learns what prediction metrics correlate most strongly with next-day returns and then adjusts itself to make each successive day's predictions better. Stocks higher up on the list are predicted to have the highest returns over the next 3 weeks, but daily returns for individual stocks vary drastically.
