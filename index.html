Every day behind the scenes, our custom machine-learning framework learns what prediction metrics correlated most strongly with next-day returns and then adjusts itself to make each successive day's predictions better. Stocks higher up on the list are predicted to have the highest average returns, but daily returns for individual stocks vary drastically. Forming a portfolio of multiple stocks can reduce daily risks.<br /><br /><strong>Contribute:</strong> Our mission is to further democratize finance by organizing high-quality publicly available information into actionable rankings.
